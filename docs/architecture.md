# Architecture decisions

This document explains every major technical decision and the reasoning behind
it.

---

## Data sources

### PageSpeed Insights API (primary)

All Lighthouse and CrUX data comes from the **PageSpeed Insights API v5** — a
single Google endpoint that returns both lab data and real-user field data in
one call.

```
GET https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed
  ?url={url}
  &strategy={mobile|desktop}
  &category=performance
  &category=seo
  &category=accessibility
  &category=best-practices
  &key={GOOGLE_API_KEY}
```

**Important:** `URLSearchParams` won't duplicate keys via object spread — append
each category individually with `.append("category", ...)`.

One call returns:

- **`lighthouseResult`** — Lab data: LCP, CLS, INP, FCP, TTFB, TBT, Speed
  Index, full audit list, and all 4 category scores (performance, SEO,
  accessibility, best-practices)
- **`loadingExperience`** — Page-level CrUX P75 values for LCP, CLS, INP, and
  FCP. Falls back to **`originLoadingExperience`** (origin-level) when
  page-level metrics are absent.

**Why not run Lighthouse directly?**
Running Lighthouse CLI on Vercel is impractical — no headless Chrome, cold
start time, and binary size limits. The PSI API is free (25,000 req/day with
a key), always runs the latest Lighthouse version, and returns both data
sources in a single call.

**Limitations:**

- Rate-limited per IP without a key (400 req/day) — always set `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Results are cached by Google for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute
- Some URLs aren't in CrUX (low-traffic sites) — handled with a lab-data-only
  fallback
- Does not support authenticated pages or interaction-dependent SPAs
- INP has no Lighthouse lab value — `crux_inp` (CrUX P75) is the only INP
  source

**CrUX API shape gotchas:**

- P75 values live at `metrics.METRIC_NAME.percentile` (flat integer), not
  `percentiles.p75`
- `CUMULATIVE_LAYOUT_SHIFT_SCORE` is stored ×100 (for example, `10` = CLS
  `0.10`) — divide by 100 before grading
- Always read `originLoadingExperience` as fallback when
  `loadingExperience.metrics` is empty

---

### CrUX History API

For 25 weeks of historical real-user field data, the **Chrome UX Report
History API** provides weekly P75 snapshots. This powers the real-user toggle
in the history chart.

```
POST https://chromeuxreport.googleapis.com/v1/records:queryHistoryRecord
```

- Same `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — requires **"Chrome UX Report API"** enabled
  separately in Google Cloud Console
- Tries page-level URL first, falls back to origin-level
- Returns null silently when the URL isn't in the CrUX dataset (low-traffic
  sites)
- Fetched fire-and-forget after each audit insert — never blocks the audit
  result
- Stored as JSONB snapshot in `audit_results.crux_history_raw`

The chart toggle only renders when `cruxHistoryRaw` is non-null, so the
feature degrades gracefully for low-traffic sites.

---

## Site Health score

A composite score displayed at the top of every project page and share link:

```typescript
const siteHealth = Math.round(
  perfScore * 0.4 + seoScore * 0.3 + accessibilityScore * 0.3
)
```

Best Practices is shown in the 2×2 grid but excluded from the composite — it's
informational. This gives agencies a single headline number to report to
clients.

---

## Multi-page scanning

Each project supports auditing **multiple sub-pages** (for example, `/`,
`/products`, `/blog`). Pages are stored in the `project_pages` table, and
every audit result is scoped to a specific page via `page_id`.

**Behavior:**

- New projects auto-create a default page from the project's primary URL
- Old audit results without a `page_id` are automatically migrated on first
  page view
- Page tabs appear on the project page when more than one page exists
- Each plan has a `maxPagesPerProject` limit: Free=2, Starter=10, Pro=50,
  Agency=unlimited

**Why per-page rather than per-project?**
Auditing a homepage versus a product page yields very different results.
Agencies need granular visibility, not just an average across all pages.
Per-page history is also cleaner for regression detection.

---

## Database: Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)

**Why Neon over Supabase, PlanetScale, or Railway?**

- Native Vercel integration (connect in the Vercel dashboard)
- Branch-per-preview-deployment support
- Auto-suspend scales cost to zero when idle (good for early stage)
- Full PostgreSQL — no MySQL syntax, no proxy layer

**Why Drizzle over Prisma?**

- Generates plain SQL — easier to debug
- Smaller bundle (important for Vercel Functions)
- Better TypeScript inference on query results
- Migrations are SQL files — no engine process needed

**Drizzle gotchas:**

- `timestamptz` is not exported from `drizzle-orm/pg-core` v0.45 — use a
  local alias:
  `const timestamptz = (name: string) => timestamp(name, { withTimezone: true })`
- `drizzle-kit` doesn't auto-load `.env.local` — call
  `config({ path: ".env.local" })` from `dotenv` at the top of
  `drizzle.config.ts`
- Schema push: always use `pnpm exec drizzle-kit push --force` (not
  `pnpm db:push` — double-dash flag issue in pnpm scripts)

---

## Authentication: Clerk

**Why Clerk over NextAuth / Auth.js / Lucia?**

- Handles email verification, 2FA, and social logins out of the box
- User management UI at no extra development cost
- Webhook events (`user.created`, `user.deleted`) to sync with the DB
- Organizations (teams) built-in — needed for Agency plan multi-user teams
- Billing-friendly: first 10,000 MAUs are free

**Clerk setup pattern (Next.js 16):**

```
ClerkProvider (root layout)
  → proxy.ts (not middleware.ts — Next.js 16 convention) protects (dashboard)
    routes
  → webhook /api/webhooks/clerk syncs user to DB
```

**Note:** Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` as the Clerk middleware file, not
`middleware.ts`. The middleware exports `clerkMiddleware` from
`@clerk/nextjs/server`.

**Organizations (Agency plan):**
Clerk Organizations power multi-user teams. Enable them in **Clerk Dashboard →
Settings → Organizations**.

- `orgId` is available from `auth()` alongside `userId`
- All ownership queries check `orgId` (when active) or fall back to `userId`
  with `isNull(projects.org_id)`
- `OrganizationSwitcher` appears in the dashboard header for Agency plan users
  only
- Creating an org is available to all Agency users; non-Agency users see only
  the personal workspace

---

## Background jobs: Upstash QStash

Scheduled audit runs can't complete within a standard Vercel Function (max 60s
on hobby, 300s on pro). The flow is:

```
Vercel Cron (hourly)
  → POST /api/cron/trigger-audits
    → QStash: enqueue one job per project due (nextAuditAt ≤ now)
      → QStash delivers to /api/jobs/run-audit?projectId=xxx
          → Calls PSI API (all 4 Lighthouse categories)
          → Saves AuditResult to DB
          → Evaluates alert conditions
          → Sends email if degraded (Resend)
          → Fire-and-forget: CrUX History fetch + AI action plan generation
```

**Why QStash over Vercel Cron alone?**
Vercel Cron fires on a fixed schedule but doesn't scale per-project. QStash
handles retries, delivery guarantees, and fan-out across many projects.

**Why Upstash Redis?**

- Cache PSI API responses (same URL + strategy) for 5 minutes
- Prevent duplicate cron runs
- Rate limiting per user for high-frequency endpoints
- Edge-compatible (Vercel Edge Middleware can read it)

## AI: Claude API (Anthropic)

**Model selection — tiered by plan:**

| Plan | DB key | Model |
|------|--------|-------|
| Grátis | `free` | — (static plan only) |
| Freelancer | `starter` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| Studio | `pro` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Agência | `agency` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |

Higher-tier plans use Sonnet for better reasoning quality and more precise
recommendations. This difference is a tangible product differentiator between
Starter and Studio/Agency.

**What it does:**

- Generates 4–6 personalized, Portuguese action plan items per audit
- Detects tech stack from Lighthouse's built-in `stackPacks` (Next.js, Nuxt,
  WordPress, and others)
- Includes all 5 CWV metrics as context: LCP, INP (CrUX P75), CLS, FCP, TTFB
- Includes SEO and Accessibility scores with failing audit IDs
- Extracts top failing performance audits with specific resource details (file
  names, wasted bytes, blocking times) so recommendations are file-specific,
  not generic

**Output format** — each item in the JSON array:

```json
{
  "title": "Short title (≤8 words)",
  "action": "Problem + solution summary (≤2 sentences)",
  "steps": [
    "Concrete implementation step — may include a terminal command or code snippet",
    "Step 2",
    "Step 3"
  ],
  "why": "Measurable business or SEO impact (1 sentence)",
  "difficulty": "Fácil | Médio | Difícil",
  "stackTip": "Stack-specific instruction (omitted when stack not detected)"
}
```

Backtick-wrapped code in `steps`, `action`, and `stackTip` is rendered as
styled `<code>` elements in the UI (`InlineCode` component in
`ActionPlan.tsx`).

**Token budget:**
`max_tokens: 4096` — required to fit a complete 4–6 item response with
multi-step content without truncation.

**Tiered access limits:**

| Plan | AI plans per month |
|------|-------------------|
| `free` | 0 — static plan only |
| `starter` | 5 |
| `pro` | 30 |
| `agency` | Unlimited |

**Caching:** Output is saved in `audit_results.ai_action_plan` (JSONB). It's
never regenerated for the same audit record — the quota is consumed once per
audit.

**Cost estimate:** Each call uses approximately 800–1,500 tokens. At Sonnet
pricing, 1,000 AI plans per month ≈ $3–5. Negligible relative to subscription
revenue.

**Error handling:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is optional. Any error (missing key,
API failure, malformed JSON) silently falls back to the static plan. AI
generation never blocks the audit save.

---

## PDF generation: @react-pdf/renderer

**Why not Puppeteer/Playwright?**
Puppeteer requires a full Chromium install. Vercel Functions don't support it
(binary size and memory limits). `@react-pdf/renderer` generates PDFs using
React components compiled to PDF primitives — no browser needed, runs in any
serverless function.

**Pattern:**

```tsx
// src/lib/pdf/AuditReport.tsx
import { Document, Page, Text, View, Image } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

export function AuditReportPDF({ audit, project, branding }: Props) {
  return (
    <Document>
      <Page>...</Page>
    </Document>
  )
}
```

Generated PDFs are uploaded to Vercel Blob storage. The URL is saved in the
`reports` table and returned to the user for download.

**White-label branding (Agency plan):**
The `branding` prop accepts:

- `agencyLogoUrl` — remote image URL rendered on the cover page using
  `<Image>`
- `agencyName` — shown above the report title and in the page footer
- `agencyContact` — shown in the cover page footer (replaces "perfally.com")
- `accentColor` — hex string applied as the top accent bar color on every page

**Important: logo URLs must be absolute.** `@react-pdf/renderer` fetches
images in the Node.js API route context, where relative paths like
`/uploads/logos/…` can't resolve. The reports route converts any relative
`agencyLogoUrl` to an absolute URL using the incoming request's origin before
passing it to the PDF component:

```typescript
function absoluteUrl(url: string | null | undefined, origin: string): string | null {
  if (!url) return null
  if (url.startsWith("http://") || url.startsWith("https://")) return url
  return `${origin}${url.startsWith("/") ? "" : "/"}${url}`
}
```

**Local dev fallback for logo uploads:**
When `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is not set, logos are saved to
`public/uploads/logos/{userId}/` and served at `/uploads/logos/…`. These
paths are gitignored. The absolute URL conversion above makes them work in
local PDF generation. In production, Vercel Blob always returns absolute
`https://…` URLs.

---

## Email: Resend

- React Email for templates (same component DX as building UI)
- Generous free tier (3,000 emails per month)
- Excellent deliverability out of the box

**Email types in the system:**

- **Alert** — metric degraded below a configured threshold
- **Weekly digest** — performance summary across all projects (Phase 3)
- **Report ready** — PDF download link (Phase 3)
- **Billing** — payment failed, subscription changed

---

## Payments: Stripe

**Subscription model:**

- Flat monthly subscriptions — no metered billing
- One product per tier: Freelancer R$89, Studio R$199, Agência R$449
- DB `plan` enum values are fixed: `"starter"`, `"pro"`, `"agency"` —
  display names are UI-only and can change without migration
- Stripe Customer Portal for self-service plan changes and cancellations
- Webhooks sync subscription lifecycle events
  (`customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`) to the DB

**Important:** Store the Stripe Customer ID and plan on the user record in your
DB. Always check `users.plan` (not the Stripe API) on each request to avoid
latency.

---

## Vercel deployment

```
main branch      → production (perf-ally.com)
preview branches → preview URLs (auto, per PR)
```

**Environment variables per environment:**

- Production: real Stripe keys, Neon production branch
- Preview: Stripe test mode keys, Neon dev branch (use Neon branching feature)

**Vercel Cron** (defined in `vercel.json`):

```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/cron/trigger-audits", "schedule": "0 * * * *" }
  ]
}
```

Runs hourly; the handler queries `nextAuditAt ≤ now` to determine which
projects are due. Daily audits fire at 15:00 UTC (noon BRT).

---

## Core Web Vitals: thresholds and grading

Google's official thresholds (as of 2025):

| Metric | Good     | Needs improvement | Poor      |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| LCP    | ≤ 2.5s   | 2.5s – 4.0s       | > 4.0s    |
| INP    | ≤ 200ms  | 200ms – 500ms     | > 500ms   |
| CLS    | ≤ 0.1    | 0.1 – 0.25        | > 0.25    |
| FCP    | ≤ 1.8s   | 1.8s – 3.0s       | > 3.0s    |
| TTFB   | ≤ 800ms  | 800ms – 1,800ms   | > 1,800ms |

**Note:** INP replaced FID as a Core Web Vital. Lighthouse lab data can't
produce an INP value — only CrUX field data provides it.

**Performance score mapping** (Lighthouse composite):

- 90–100: Good (green)
- 50–89: Needs improvement (amber)
- 0–49: Poor (red)

Pre-computed grades are stored in the DB (`lcp_grade`, `cls_grade`,
`inp_grade`). Don't recompute grades from raw values in the UI — Google may
update the thresholds without requiring a schema change.

## Plan enforcement

Plan limits are defined in `src/lib/utils/plan-limits.ts` as a `PLAN_LIMITS`
constant keyed by plan string.

| Limit | Enforcement point |
|-------|-------------------|
| `maxProjects` | `createProjectAction` (server action) |
| `maxPagesPerProject` | `addPageAction` (server action) |
| `manualRunsPerMonth` | Audit route via `getMonthlyRunCount` |
| `historyDays` | Date filter on history queries (not row limit) |
| `aiActionPlansPerMonth` | `maybeGenerateAIActionPlan` in `audit-runner.ts` |
| `scheduledRuns` / `hourlyRuns` | Schedule selector UI + cron trigger handler |
| `pdfReports` | PDF route + download button + ReportHistory component |

Upstash Redis is available for sliding-window rate limits on high-frequency
endpoints (for example, the public `/check` analyzer in Phase 4).

---

## Plain-English action plans (static fallback)

Every metric has a static explanation and action plan in
`src/lib/utils/explanations.ts`. The `getActionPlan()` function maps failed
Lighthouse audit IDs to prioritized fix recommendations. This is always the
fallback for:

- Free plan users (`aiActionPlansPerMonth: 0`)
- Users who have exhausted their monthly AI quota
- Any AI generation failure (missing key, API error, malformed response)

The static plan is a safety net — the product is never left without
recommendations.

---

## Security

- All PSI calls happen server-side — `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is never exposed to the
  client
- Clerk middleware protects all `/dashboard` routes via `proxy.ts`
- Project and page ownership is verified on every API call — org-aware: checks
  `org_id` when an org session is active, otherwise checks `user_id` with an
  `IS NULL` guard on `org_id`
- Stripe webhooks are verified with `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`
- No user-provided HTML is rendered unsanitized
- URL validation blocks localhost, private IPs (including link-local
  `169.254.x.x` and the RFC 6598 CGNAT range `100.64.0.0/10`), and
  non-HTTP(S) schemes before the PSI call
- Share tokens are random UUIDs — not guessable, not sequential
- Security headers set on all responses: `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`,
  `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `Permissions-Policy`
