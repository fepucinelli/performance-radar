## Complementary Ideas to Explore

These are adjacent ideas worth evaluating once core revenue is stable:

### "One-time audit" product (Phase 3+)
A $29 one-time purchase for a full report PDF with custom recommendations. No subscription. Targets consultants and freelancers who need a deliverable for a client. Zero account required.

### Performance regression as a service (Phase 5)
"Did your last deploy break performance?" integrates with Vercel, Netlify, GitHub deploy hooks. When a new deploy happens, auto-trigger an audit and compare with previous. Email if regression > 10%.

### Lighthouse as an API (Phase 5)
White-label the audit engine. Charge per-call for developers who want Lighthouse results without running infra. Simple pricing: $0.01/audit. Targets agencies building their own tools.

### Managed CrUX insights newsletter (Phase 4)
Weekly email: "Here's how your site changed vs last week." Personalized, automated, no dashboard needed. Converts free users who don't log in.

### Vertical SaaS editions (Phase 5+)
- Performance Radar for Shopify (connect store, auto-detect product/checkout pages)
- Performance Radar for WordPress (plugin-based, auto-discover posts)
- Performance Radar for Next.js (GitHub integration, per-route tracking)

## Pricing Evolution Path

**Start (Phase 1):**
- Free: 1 project, manual only

**Phase 2:**
- Free: 1 project, 10 runs/month
- Starter $19: 5 projects, daily monitoring, email alerts
- Pro $49: 20 projects, hourly monitoring, all alerts

**Phase 3:**
- Add Agency $99: 100 projects, teams, PDF reports, white-label

**Phase 4+:**
- Consider annual pricing (2 months free = 17% discount)
- Consider usage-based add-ons (extra projects, extra runs)
- Consider LTD (lifetime deal) on AppSumo for growth spike

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| PSI API rate limits | Use API key, cache results, Upstash rate limiter |
| CrUX data unavailable for small sites | Lab-only mode with clear UI explanation |
| PSI API goes down | Retry with exponential backoff in QStash |
| Lighthouse scores fluctuate between runs | Show moving average, document methodology |
| Low CWV awareness in SMB market | Content marketing, education in onboarding |
| Churn due to "set and forget" | Weekly digest email keeps users engaged |
